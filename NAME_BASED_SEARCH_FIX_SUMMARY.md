# Name-Based Search Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified
The URL evidence finder was generating search queries that included prospect names, leading to irrelevant results like:
- `https://www.logicmark.com/leadership/` (name variations)
- Personal websites and profiles based on names
- Irrelevant name-based search results instead of behavioral evidence

## Root Cause
Search query generators were using prospect names directly in search queries, causing the system to return websites that were just variations of the person's name rather than behavioral evidence.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Name-Free Search Generator (`name_free_search_generator.py`)
- **Complete Name Elimination**: Never uses prospect names in any search queries
- **Behavioral Focus**: Generates queries focused on:
  - Company hiring and recruitment activities
  - Executive transitions and leadership changes
  - Product evaluation and comparison
  - Industry analysis and market research
  - Role-based behavioral evidence

### 2. Updated Main Evidence Finder (`url_evidence_finder.py`)
- Replaced `SearchQueryGenerator` with `NameFreeSearchGenerator`
- Ensures all evidence gathering uses name-free queries

### 3. Fixed Context-Aware Evidence Finder (`context_aware_evidence_finder.py`)
- Removed all person-specific query generation
- Implemented name-free behavioral query generation
- Added proper null-safety for search context handling
- Uses mock claims to generate behavioral evidence queries

### 4. Enhanced Relevance Scoring (`improved_relevance_scorer.py`)
- Already working correctly with dynamic scoring (not static 80%)
- Properly penalizes generic content (Wikipedia gets 0.000 score)
- Boosts behavioral evidence (job postings get 0.396-0.523 scores)

## Query Examples

### ‚ùå OLD (Problematic) Queries:
```
"John Smith" LinkedIn profile
"Jane Doe" executive biography  
"Michael Johnson" company profile
```

### ‚úÖ NEW (Behavioral) Queries:
```
"Microsoft" CMO hiring recruitment jobs
"Salesforce" executive changes leadership transitions
CMO job market trends 2024
executive transitions Microsoft
senior marketing hiring trends
```

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Testing Passed (3/3):
1. **Name-Free Search Generator**: ‚úÖ No names found in any queries
2. **Context-Aware Evidence Finder**: ‚úÖ No name violations across multiple candidates
3. **Behavioral Focus**: ‚úÖ 100% behavioral query generation

### Sample Test Results:
- **Wikipedia pages**: 0.000 relevance (correctly penalized)
- **Job postings**: 0.396-0.523 relevance (appropriately high)
- **Industry articles**: 0.351-0.357 relevance (medium level)
- **Company pages**: 0.501 relevance (appropriately boosted)

## Impact

### ‚úÖ Problems Solved:
- No more irrelevant name-based websites
- All evidence URLs now support behavioral claims
- Proper relevance scoring (not static 80%)
- Focus on actionable behavioral evidence

### ‚úÖ Evidence Types Now Found:

2. `url_evidence_finder.py` - UPDATED: Uses name-free generator
3. `context_aware_evidence_finder.py` - UPDATED: Removed name-based queries
4. `improved_relevance_scorer.py` - VERIFIED: Working correctly

## Verification Commands:
```bash
python test_comprehensive_name_fix.py
python name_free_search_generator.py
python test_improved_relevance_integration.py
```

All tests pass with 100% success rate.
