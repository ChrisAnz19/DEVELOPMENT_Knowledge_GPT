# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the recurring warning "Search [request_id] has null prompt, using default" that appears in the system logs. The issue appears to be related to how data is being accessed or stored rather than the data itself being invalid. This feature will investigate and fix the root cause of null prompts appearing in the database operations, focusing on proper data handling and storage mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to identify why prompts are appearing as null during database operations, so that the root cause can be fixed and warnings eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search data is processed THEN the system SHALL properly access and preserve prompt data throughout the storage pipeline
2. WHEN storing search data THEN the system SHALL ensure prompt values are correctly mapped and stored
3. WHEN retrieving search data THEN the system SHALL correctly access prompt fields without null values
4. WHEN prompt data exists in the source THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity through all operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the data flow for search prompts, so that I can identify where prompt data is being lost or incorrectly accessed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search data flows through the system THEN each step SHALL preserve prompt data correctly
2. WHEN data mapping occurs THEN prompt fields SHALL be correctly mapped between data structures
3. WHEN database operations execute THEN prompt values SHALL be properly serialized and deserialized
4. WHEN data transformations happen THEN prompt data SHALL remain intact and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the null prompt warnings to be eliminated through proper data handling, so that logs are clean and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search operations complete THEN no null prompt warnings SHALL be generated
2. WHEN prompt data is available THEN it SHALL be correctly stored and retrieved without fallback to defaults
3. WHEN database operations execute THEN prompt fields SHALL contain the actual prompt values
4. WHEN logging occurs THEN it SHALL reflect successful prompt data handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to ensure that existing null prompt records are properly investigated and potentially corrected, so that data quality is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing searches are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in null prompt occurrences
2. WHEN null prompts are found THEN the system SHALL determine if the original data contained valid prompts
3. WHEN data correction is possible THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to restore proper prompt values
4. WHEN historical data is accessed THEN it SHALL be handled consistently with the corrected data flow
