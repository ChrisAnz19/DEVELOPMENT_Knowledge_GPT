# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure backend OAuth integration for HubSpot that handles the token exchange process. The backend will receive authorization codes from the frontend, exchange them for access and refresh tokens with HubSpot's OAuth API, and return the tokens securely to the frontend. This enables users to connect their HubSpot accounts through a seamless OAuth flow while keeping sensitive credentials server-side.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to exchange HubSpot authorization codes for access tokens, so that users can securely connect their HubSpot accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/hubspot/oauth/token` with a valid authorization code and redirect_uri THEN the system SHALL exchange the code for access and refresh tokens with HubSpot
2. WHEN the token exchange is successful THEN the system SHALL return the access token, refresh token, and expiration information to the frontend
3. WHEN the authorization code is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with appropriate error message
4. WHEN HubSpot's OAuth API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a 503 error with retry information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want HubSpot OAuth credentials to be securely managed, so that sensitive information is never exposed to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load HubSpot client ID and client secret from secure environment variables
2. WHEN making requests to HubSpot's OAuth API THEN the system SHALL use the stored client credentials without exposing them
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
4. IF client credentials are invalid THEN HubSpot SHALL return authentication errors that are properly handled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for OAuth failures, so that users receive clear feedback when authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HubSpot returns an OAuth error THEN the system SHALL parse the error response and return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL return a 504 error with timeout information
3. WHEN malformed requests are received THEN the system SHALL return a 422 error with validation details
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 error with retry-after headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application, I want request validation and CORS handling, so that only authorized frontend applications can use the OAuth endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are made from unauthorized origins THEN the system SHALL reject them with CORS errors
2. WHEN required fields (code, redirect_uri) are missing THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with field validation details
3. WHEN the redirect_uri doesn't match expected patterns THEN the system SHALL reject the request for security
4. WHEN requests contain malicious payloads THEN the system SHALL sanitize inputs and prevent injection attacks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want comprehensive logging of OAuth operations, so that authentication issues can be debugged and security events tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth token exchanges occur THEN the system SHALL log the operation with timestamps and success/failure status
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events with appropriate severity levels
4. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating but attempt to restore logging functionality
