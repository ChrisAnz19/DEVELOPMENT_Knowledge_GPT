# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the missing HubSpot OAuth API endpoints that the frontend expects to exist. Currently, the system has a `HubSpotOAuthClient` class but no actual API routes to handle OAuth token exchange requests. The frontend is making requests to `/api/hubspot/oauth/token` which returns 404 because the endpoint doesn't exist.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to exchange HubSpot authorization codes for access tokens, so that users can complete the OAuth flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/hubspot/oauth/token` THEN the system SHALL accept the request
2. WHEN the request contains valid authorization code and redirect_uri THEN the system SHALL exchange them for tokens using HubSpot's API
3. WHEN the token exchange succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the access token, refresh token, and expiration data
4. WHEN the token exchange fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to check the health of the HubSpot OAuth service, so that I can verify the integration is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/hubspot/oauth/health` THEN the system SHALL return a health status
2. WHEN HubSpot credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL return healthy status
3. WHEN HubSpot credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL return unhealthy status with details
4. IF the health check succeeds THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with status information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for OAuth requests, so that I can debug integration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation errors
2. WHEN HubSpot credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with configuration error
3. WHEN HubSpot API returns errors THEN the system SHALL forward appropriate error messages
4. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 502 with timeout error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the OAuth endpoints to use the existing HubSpotOAuthClient, so that the implementation is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the endpoints THEN the system SHALL use the existing HubSpotOAuthClient class
2. WHEN handling token exchange THEN the system SHALL call the exchange_code_for_tokens method
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use the existing error handling patterns
4. IF the client class needs modifications THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to get the HubSpot authorization URL, so that I can redirect users to start the OAuth flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/hubspot/oauth/authorize` THEN the system SHALL return the HubSpot authorization URL
2. WHEN the request includes redirect_uri parameter THEN the system SHALL include it in the authorization URL
3. WHEN the request includes scope parameter THEN the system SHALL include it in the authorization URL
4. WHEN HubSpot credentials are not configured THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with configuration error
