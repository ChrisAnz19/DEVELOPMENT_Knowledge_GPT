# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses deployment and integration issues with the Prismatic.io integration where the HubSpot OAuth endpoints are implemented in the API but the integration is not showing runs in the Prismatic dashboard. The system appears to have a disconnect between the deployed API endpoints and the actual Prismatic integration execution, suggesting configuration or deployment synchronization problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the deployed API matches the local development environment, so that I can identify deployment synchronization issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing local and production endpoints THEN the system SHALL have identical route availability
2. WHEN the debug endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the same route information in both environments
3. WHEN endpoints return 404 in production but work locally THEN the system SHALL identify the deployment gap
4. IF there are missing routes in production THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand why the Prismatic integration shows no runs, so that I can fix the integration connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking Prismatic dashboard THEN the system SHALL verify if the integration is properly configured
2. WHEN the API endpoints are working THEN the system SHALL verify if Prismatic can reach them
3. WHEN webhooks or callbacks are expected THEN the system SHALL verify they are properly configured
4. IF the integration is not triggering THEN the system SHALL identify the root cause

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive deployment diagnostics, so that I can quickly identify and resolve deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL check API endpoint availability
2. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL verify environment variable configuration
3. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL test external service connectivity
4. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide actionable remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the Prismatic integration configuration, so that I can ensure proper webhook and callback setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking integration config THEN the system SHALL verify webhook URLs are correct
2. WHEN checking integration config THEN the system SHALL verify authentication credentials
3. WHEN checking integration config THEN the system SHALL verify trigger conditions
4. IF configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated deployment verification, so that I can catch deployment issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL automatically verify all endpoints
2. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL test integration connectivity
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify environment configuration
4. IF deployment verification fails THEN the system SHALL alert with specific error details
