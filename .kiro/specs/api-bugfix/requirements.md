# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix critical bugs in the Knowledge_GPT API that are causing search processing errors, database constraint violations, and infinite loops. The fixes will ensure stable operation of the API, proper handling of asynchronous operations, prevention of database conflicts, and elimination of infinite loops in the search processing flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the async/await usage in the search processing code, so that searches are processed correctly without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a search THEN it SHALL correctly use async/await syntax with appropriate objects
2. WHEN an async function is called THEN it SHALL be properly awaited
3. WHEN non-awaitable objects are used THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately without trying to await them
4. WHEN the search processing completes THEN it SHALL not produce "object list can't be used in 'await' expression" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the database constraint violations, so that searches are stored correctly without duplicate key errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing search data in the database THEN it SHALL check for existing records to prevent duplicate keys
2. WHEN updating search status THEN it SHALL use the correct primary key handling to avoid constraint violations
3. WHEN a database error occurs THEN it SHALL be properly logged and handled without crashing the application
4. WHEN multiple search updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain database integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the infinite loop issue in the search processing flow, so that searches complete properly without getting stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a search THEN it SHALL have proper termination conditions to prevent infinite loops
2. WHEN handling callbacks and recursive functions THEN it SHALL include appropriate exit conditions
3. WHEN a search is completed THEN it SHALL properly update the status without triggering additional processing
4. WHEN the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL gracefully exit the processing flow without entering a loop
