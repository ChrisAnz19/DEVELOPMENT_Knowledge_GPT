# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Behavioral Metrics feature aims to enhance the existing behavioral data analysis by adding four new specialized metrics: Commitment Momentum Index (CMI), Risk-Barrier Focus Score (RBFS), Identity Alignment Signal (IAS), and Psychometric Modeling Insight. These metrics will provide deeper insights into prospect behavior, helping users better understand prospect engagement patterns, risk sensitivity, value alignment, and psychological drivers. The metrics will be exposed through the API and integrated into the existing behavioral_data section of search responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a Commitment Momentum Index (CMI) for prospects, so that I can understand their progression through the buying journey and identify those with higher urgency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates behavioral data THEN it SHALL include a commitment_momentum_index object with a score (0-100) and description
2. WHEN calculating the CMI score THEN the system SHALL consider engagement with bottom-of-funnel content, recency and frequency of sessions, and off-hours activity
3. WHEN generating the CMI description THEN it SHALL provide a concise explanation of the score (e.g., "Active: Reviewing implementation guides")
4. WHEN the system returns CMI data THEN it SHALL be included in the behavioral_data section of the search response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a Risk-Barrier Focus Score (RBFS) for prospects, so that I can identify risk-averse prospects who may require additional assurance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates behavioral data THEN it SHALL include a risk_barrier_focus_score object with a score (0-100) and description
2. WHEN calculating the RBFS THEN the system SHALL consider engagement with risk-related content such as "pros & cons," negative reviews, and compliance pages
3. WHEN generating the RBFS description THEN it SHALL provide a concise explanation of the score (e.g., "Low concern: Focused on benefits")
4. WHEN the system returns RBFS data THEN it SHALL be included in the behavioral_data section of the search response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an Identity Alignment Signal (IAS) for prospects, so that I can understand how well my solution aligns with their self-image and values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates behavioral data THEN it SHALL include an identity_alignment_signal object with a score (0-100) and description
2. WHEN calculating the IAS THEN the system SHALL consider engagement with purpose-driven content, thought leadership articles, and community posts
3. WHEN generating the IAS description THEN it SHALL provide a concise explanation of the score (e.g., "Strong alignment: Values-driven decision")
4. WHEN the system returns IAS data THEN it SHALL be included in the behavioral_data section of the search response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a Psychometric Modeling Insight for prospects, so that I can tailor my communication approach based on their psychological profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates behavioral data THEN it SHALL include a psychometric_modeling_insight string with actionable communication advice
2. WHEN generating the psychometric insight THEN the system SHALL analyze all available behavioral data to infer underlying psychological drivers
3. WHEN generating the psychometric insight THEN it SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations on how to approach or communicate with the prospect
4. WHEN the system returns the psychometric insight THEN it SHALL be included in the behavioral_data section of the search response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new behavioral metrics to be exposed through the API, so that frontend applications can display these insights to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API returns search results THEN it SHALL include the new behavioral metrics in the behavioral_data object
2. WHEN the API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include descriptions and examples of the new behavioral metrics
3. WHEN the API processes requests THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing clients
4. WHEN the API returns the new metrics THEN they SHALL follow the specified format for each metric type
