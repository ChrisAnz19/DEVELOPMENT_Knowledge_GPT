# Profile Photo Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

The current system occasionally shows LinkedIn's default fallback image (`https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/9c8pery4andzj6ohjkjp54ma2`) instead of actual candidate profile photos. This reduces the visual quality and professional appearance of search results. We need to implement enhanced profile photo handling to ensure high-quality, relevant profile images are consistently displayed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Photo Validation and Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a user viewing search results, I want to see actual candidate profile photos instead of generic placeholder images, so that I can better identify and connect with potential prospects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a LinkedIn profile photo URL THEN it SHALL validate that the URL points to an actual profile photo and not a fallback image
2. WHEN a fallback image URL is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to find alternative photo sources
3. WHEN no valid profile photo is available THEN the system SHALL use a high-quality custom placeholder instead of LinkedIn's generic fallback
4. WHEN multiple photo sources are available THEN the system SHALL select the highest quality option based on resolution and recency

### Requirement 2: Alternative Photo Source Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to find the best available profile photo from multiple sources, so that I have a clear visual representation of each candidate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LinkedIn profile photos are unavailable or low quality THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve photos from alternative professional sources
2. WHEN using alternative photo sources THEN the system SHALL respect privacy and terms of service requirements
3. WHEN multiple photo sources provide different images THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent and professional-looking photo
4. WHEN no photos are available from any source THEN the system SHALL generate or use a professional placeholder that maintains visual consistency

### Requirement 3: Photo Caching and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want profile photos to load quickly and consistently, so that my search experience is smooth and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid profile photos are identified THEN the system SHALL cache them locally to improve loading performance
2. WHEN cached photos become outdated THEN the system SHALL refresh them automatically based on configurable intervals
3. WHEN photo loading fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to cached versions or high-quality placeholders
4. WHEN displaying search results THEN profile photos SHALL load within 2 seconds to maintain user experience quality

### Requirement 4: Photo Quality Scoring and Selection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the best available profile photo for each candidate, so that I can make informed decisions about potential prospects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating profile photos THEN the system SHALL score them based on resolution, clarity, professionalism, and recency
2. WHEN multiple photos are available for a candidate THEN the system SHALL automatically select the highest-scoring option
3. WHEN photo quality is below acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL prefer a professional placeholder over a poor-quality image
4. WHEN photo scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL store quality metrics for future optimization and reporting
