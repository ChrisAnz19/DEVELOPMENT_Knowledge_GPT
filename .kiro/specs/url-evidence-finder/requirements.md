# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current system provides candidate explanations and behavioral insights but lacks supporting evidence in the form of specific URLs that validate these claims. Users need to see concrete evidence for statements like "prospect is researching Salesforce pricing" or "actively evaluating CRM solutions." This microsystem will analyze candidate explanations and use web search to find 3-5 specific URLs that support each reason, providing credible evidence for the behavioral insights and increasing user confidence in the results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Explanation Analysis and URL Discovery

**User Story:** As a user reviewing candidate explanations, I want to see specific URLs that support each behavioral insight, so that I can verify the claims and have concrete evidence for my outreach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives candidate explanations/reasons THEN it SHALL analyze each explanation to identify searchable claims and statements
2. WHEN an explanation mentions a specific company or product (e.g., "Salesforce pricing page") THEN the system SHALL prioritize finding the exact URL mentioned
3. WHEN an explanation contains general behavioral claims (e.g., "researching CRM solutions") THEN the system SHALL find relevant URLs that support this activity
4. WHEN processing explanations THEN the system SHALL return 3-5 high-quality URLs per candidate that best support their behavioral insights
5. WHEN no specific URLs can be found THEN the system SHALL find the most relevant general resources that align with the stated behavior

### Requirement 2: Web Search Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use OpenAI's web search capabilities to find current and relevant URLs, so that the evidence is up-to-date and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for evidence URLs THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI's web search tool with appropriate search queries
2. WHEN constructing search queries THEN the system SHALL extract key terms from explanations and create targeted searches
3. WHEN a company or product is mentioned THEN the system SHALL include the company name in search queries to find official pages
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL prioritize official company pages, product pages, and authoritative sources
5. WHEN web search returns results THEN the system SHALL validate URL relevance and quality before including in response

### Requirement 3: URL Quality and Relevance Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want only high-quality, relevant URLs that actually support the behavioral claims, so that I can trust the evidence provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating URLs THEN the system SHALL prioritize official company websites and product pages over third-party sources
2. WHEN an explanation mentions specific pages (pricing, features, documentation) THEN the system SHALL find those exact page types
3. WHEN filtering URLs THEN the system SHALL exclude low-quality sources like forums, ads, or unrelated content
4. WHEN multiple URLs are available THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance and authority
5. WHEN URLs are returned THEN each SHALL include a brief description of how it supports the behavioral claim

### Requirement 4: API Integration and Response Format

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the URL evidence finder to integrate seamlessly with existing candidate data, so that evidence URLs are included in search results without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing candidate data THEN the system SHALL accept existing candidate objects with explanations/reasons
2. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL add evidence URLs to candidate data without modifying existing fields
3. WHEN evidence URLs are added THEN they SHALL include URL, title, description, and relevance score
4. WHEN the system cannot find evidence THEN it SHALL return an empty evidence array rather than failing
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing clients

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the URL evidence finder to be fast and reliable, so that it doesn't significantly impact search response times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple candidates THEN the system SHALL handle batch processing efficiently
2. WHEN web searches are performed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeouts and error handling
3. WHEN search APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking candidate results
4. WHEN processing takes too long THEN the system SHALL return partial results rather than timing out
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log issues for monitoring while continuing to process other candidates

### Requirement 6: Search Query Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to find the most relevant URLs by using intelligent search strategies, so that the evidence directly supports the behavioral claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explanations mention specific companies THEN search queries SHALL include company names and relevant terms
2. WHEN explanations mention specific activities THEN search queries SHALL target those activities with appropriate keywords
3. WHEN explanations are vague THEN the system SHALL infer likely search terms based on context and industry
4. WHEN initial searches don't yield good results THEN the system SHALL try alternative search strategies
5. WHEN constructing queries THEN the system SHALL avoid overly broad searches that return irrelevant results

### Requirement 7: Evidence Categorization and Presentation

**User Story:** As a user, I want evidence URLs to be clearly categorized and explained, so that I understand how each URL supports the behavioral claim.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning evidence URLs THEN each SHALL be categorized by type (company page, product page, news article, etc.)
2. WHEN URLs are presented THEN each SHALL include a brief explanation of its relevance to the behavioral claim
3. WHEN multiple types of evidence exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize official sources over secondary sources
4. WHEN evidence quality varies THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels for each URL
5. WHEN displaying results THEN URLs SHALL be ordered by relevance and authority
