  - Create performance monitoring and timing metrics for evidence gathering
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Integrate with existing candidate processing pipeline
  - Modify existing API endpoints to include optional evidence URL enhancement
  - Update candidate response format to include evidence_urls field while maintaining backward compatibility
  - Add configuration options to enable/disable evidence finding per request
  - Implement async processing to avoid blocking main candidate search pipeline
  - Create feature flag system for gradual rollout of evidence finding
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 9. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for explanation analysis and claim extraction functionality
