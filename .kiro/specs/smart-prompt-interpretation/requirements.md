# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the AI prompt interpretation system to provide more contextually aware and intelligent filtering of prospects. The current system lacks business logic understanding, leading to counterproductive results like returning competitors when users search for potential customers. The enhanced system will understand business relationships, competitive landscapes, and intent context to deliver more relevant prospect recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want the AI to understand competitive relationships when I search for prospects, so that I don't receive leads from companies that are direct competitors to my target solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user mentions a specific product or company in their search THEN the system SHALL identify known competitors and exclude them from results
2. WHEN a user searches for prospects interested in a product category THEN the system SHALL exclude companies that already provide competing solutions in that category
3. IF a company is identified as a direct competitor THEN the system SHALL not include their employees in prospect results
4. WHEN the system detects competitive exclusion logic THEN it SHALL log the reasoning for transparency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want the AI to understand buying intent context in my searches, so that I receive prospects who are more likely to be actual buyers rather than existing providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for prospects "looking to buy" a solution THEN the system SHALL prioritize companies that don't currently provide that solution
2. WHEN a user specifies a use case or pain point THEN the system SHALL identify companies likely to have that need
3. IF a search implies procurement intent THEN the system SHALL favor prospects in buyer roles rather than vendor roles
4. WHEN analyzing company context THEN the system SHALL consider company size, industry, and growth stage as buying indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want the AI to provide reasoning for its prospect selections, so that I can understand why certain leads were included or excluded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system applies smart filtering logic THEN it SHALL provide explanatory reasoning for key decisions
2. WHEN competitors are excluded THEN the system SHALL indicate which companies were filtered out and why
3. IF the system makes assumptions about buying intent THEN it SHALL explain the contextual clues used
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include confidence indicators for prospect relevance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and maintain competitive intelligence data, so that the smart filtering remains accurate as market conditions change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new competitive relationships are identified THEN the system SHALL allow updating the competitive mapping
2. IF market conditions change THEN administrators SHALL be able to modify competitive exclusion rules
3. WHEN the system encounters unknown companies or products THEN it SHALL flag them for potential competitive analysis
4. IF competitive data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to refresh and validate relationships

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want the enhanced prompt interpretation to work seamlessly with existing filtering, so that my current workflow remains unchanged while getting better results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the smart interpretation processes a prompt THEN it SHALL enhance the existing filter parameters without changing the data flow
2. IF the enhanced system generates filtering criteria THEN it SHALL integrate with the current filtering code without modification
3. WHEN users submit prompts THEN the interface SHALL remain identical to current behavior
4. IF the smart interpretation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to current prompt processing logic
