# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create simple competitive knowledge base
  - Create a JSON file with basic competitive mappings for common products (Orum, Five9, Salesforce, etc.)
  - Write a simple function to load and parse the competitive data
  - Add basic unit tests for data loading
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 2. Build basic prompt enhancement function
  - Create a single function that detects product mentions in prompts
  - Add logic to identify competitors and generate exclusion text
  - Implement simple buying vs selling intent detection
  - Write unit tests for prompt enhancement logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 3. Integrate smart prompt enhancement into API
  - Modify api/main.py to call prompt enhancement before existing prompt formatting
  - Ensure enhanced prompt flows unchanged to parse_prompt_to_internal_database_filters
  - Add error handling to fall back to original prompt on any failure
  - Test that existing API behavior is preserved
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 4. Add basic reasoning and logging
  - Include simple reasoning in the enhanced prompt or as metadata
  - Add logging to show when and how prompts are being enhanced
  - Store enhancement decisions for transparency
  - Test that reasoning is captured and accessible
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Test and validate the improvement
  - Test with the original Orum/Five9 example to verify it works
  - Add a few more test cases for different competitive scenarios
  - Verify performance impact is minimal
  - Confirm the system gracefully handles edge cases
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.4_
