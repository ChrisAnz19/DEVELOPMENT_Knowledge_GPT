# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The URL Evidence Finder system is currently failing because it uses OpenAI's deprecated `web_search` tool type, which is no longer supported by the OpenAI API. The system needs to be updated to use alternative web search methods to continue providing evidence URLs for candidate validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the URL evidence finder to work without relying on deprecated OpenAI web search tools, so that the evidence finding functionality continues to operate reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system attempts to find evidence URLs THEN it SHALL NOT use the deprecated `"web_search"` tool type
2. WHEN the web search engine is called THEN it SHALL use a supported alternative method for web searching
3. WHEN evidence finding fails due to web search issues THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the entire search process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web search functionality to be replaced with a working alternative, so that evidence URLs can still be generated for search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the web search replacement THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface and return types
2. WHEN using the new web search method THEN it SHALL return relevant URLs for the given search queries
3. WHEN the new implementation is deployed THEN existing evidence finder functionality SHALL continue to work without breaking changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to continue receiving evidence URLs in my search results, so that I can validate the AI-generated candidate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing a search THEN the system SHALL still attempt to find evidence URLs for candidates
2. WHEN evidence URLs are found THEN they SHALL be relevant to the candidate's profile and behavior
3. WHEN web search fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing without evidence URLs rather than failing completely
