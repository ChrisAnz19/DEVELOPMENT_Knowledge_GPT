# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Focused Behavioral Insight feature aims to refine the existing behavioral metrics system by simplifying the output to provide a single, highly focused behavioral insight that offers specific, actionable guidance on how to engage with a prospect. This enhancement will replace the current multi-metric approach with a single, high-quality engagement recommendation that is contextually relevant to the user's search and the prospect's role. The feature will also ensure logical consistency between the behavioral insight and the search context. 
## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a single, focused behavioral insight for each prospect, so that I can quickly understand the most effective way to engage with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates behavioral data THEN it SHALL include only one behavioral insight instead of multiple metrics
2. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL focus on a specific way to engage with the prospect (e.g., "Ask a lot of questions to get them to feel engaged")
3. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL be tailored to the prospect's psychology and role
4. WHEN the system returns behavioral data THEN it SHALL replace the current multi-metric structure with a single insight

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the behavioral insight to be logically consistent with the search context, so that the recommendations are relevant and useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL ensure logical consistency with the user's search query
2. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL consider the prospect's role and industry context
3. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL avoid generic statements that provide no utility (e.g., "a director of sales is likely to engage in strategic discussions")
4. WHEN generating the behavioral insight THEN it SHALL provide specific, actionable guidance that is relevant to the user's goals

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to consistently see profile photos for candidates, so that I can better identify and remember them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system returns candidate data THEN it SHALL ensure profile photos are consistently displayed
2. WHEN processing candidate data THEN it SHALL prioritize finding and including profile photo URLs
3. WHEN multiple photo sources are available THEN it SHALL use a consistent prioritization strategy
4. WHEN no photo is available THEN it SHALL handle this gracefully without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API documentation to be updated to reflect the new behavioral insight format, so that frontend developers can properly integrate it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL clearly explain the new single behavioral insight format
2. WHEN the API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL provide examples of the new format
3. WHEN the API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility information
4. WHEN the API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include guidance on how to use the new format in frontend applications
