# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the HubSpot OAuth backend integration where empty or malformed JSON responses from HubSpot's OAuth API cause "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors on the frontend. The system currently fails to properly handle edge cases where HubSpot returns non-JSON responses or empty response bodies, leading to JavaScript parsing errors that break the OAuth flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want robust JSON response handling from the OAuth endpoint, so that malformed or empty responses from HubSpot don't break the authentication flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HubSpot returns an empty response body THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without attempting JSON parsing
2. WHEN HubSpot returns malformed JSON THEN the system SHALL catch the parsing error and return a structured error response
3. WHEN HubSpot returns a non-JSON content type THEN the system SHALL detect this and handle it appropriately
4. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return a consistent error format that the frontend can handle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging OAuth issues, I want detailed logging of response parsing failures, so that I can identify and resolve HubSpot API communication problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log the raw response content (excluding sensitive data)
2. WHEN empty responses are received THEN the system SHALL log the response status and headers for debugging
3. WHEN content-type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL log the expected vs actual content types
4. IF response parsing succeeds after retry THEN the system SHALL log the recovery for monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the OAuth endpoint to be resilient to HubSpot API variations, so that temporary API changes don't break user authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HubSpot changes response formats THEN the system SHALL continue to function with fallback error handling
2. WHEN network issues cause partial responses THEN the system SHALL detect incomplete data and handle appropriately
3. WHEN HubSpot returns unexpected status codes with empty bodies THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. IF multiple parsing strategies are needed THEN the system SHALL attempt them in order of preference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error response formats from the OAuth endpoint, so that error handling logic works reliably across all failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any parsing error occurs THEN the system SHALL return errors in the standard format with error, error_description, and status_code fields
2. WHEN response content cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL return a generic but informative error message
3. WHEN debugging information is available THEN the system SHALL include it in development environments only
4. IF the error is recoverable THEN the system SHALL indicate retry recommendations in the response
