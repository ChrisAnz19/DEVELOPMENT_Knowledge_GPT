# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend is successfully processing evidence URLs and finding relevant evidence data for candidates, but there is a critical data flow issue where the processed evidence is not being attached to candidates before the API response is sent. The system logs show evidence processing completing successfully (e.g., "Found 7 total evidence URLs for 2/2 candidates"), but the API response contains empty evidence arrays and default "no evidence found" messages instead of the actual evidence data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system user, I want evidence URLs that are successfully processed by the backend to be properly attached to candidate objects in API responses, so that I can see the supporting evidence that was found.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence processing completes successfully THEN the processed evidence URLs SHALL be merged back into the candidate objects before database storage
2. WHEN candidates are stored in the database THEN evidence_urls field SHALL be included in the allowed schema fields
3. WHEN evidence_urls contain array data THEN they SHALL be properly JSON serialized for database storage
4. WHEN API responses are generated THEN they SHALL include the actual evidence URLs instead of empty arrays

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the system, I want clear visibility into the evidence data flow, so that I can verify evidence is being properly attached at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence enhancement occurs THEN the system SHALL log the number of evidence URLs being attached to each candidate
2. WHEN candidates are stored to database THEN the system SHALL log whether evidence_urls field is being included
3. WHEN API responses are generated THEN the system SHALL log the evidence data being returned for each candidate
4. IF evidence processing succeeds but API response shows empty evidence THEN the system SHALL log where in the data flow the evidence was lost

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the evidence attachment fix to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence attachment is fixed THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN database schema is updated THEN existing candidate records SHALL remain accessible
3. WHEN evidence serialization is implemented THEN it SHALL handle both empty and populated evidence arrays correctly
4. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN it SHALL not break any existing evidence processing workflows
