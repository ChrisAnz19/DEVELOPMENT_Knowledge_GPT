# Evidence Search Performance and Specificity Fix Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance search query specificity
  - Modify search query generation to create location-specific and context-specific queries
  - Add query refinement logic when initial results are too generic
  - Implement multi-tier search strategy (specific â†’ broader if needed)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Add search result quality filtering
  - Implement result specificity scoring to filter out generic homepage URLs
  - Add content type detection to prioritize relevant result types
  - Create result ranking system that favors specific over generic content
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Fix API response status communication
  - Add explicit processing status fields to all evidence finding API responses
  - Include completion timestamps and processing time metrics
  - Ensure frontend receives clear signals when processing completes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Test and validate the improvements
  - Test that "homes in Greenwich" returns specific property listings
  - Verify frontend shows completion status correctly
  - Test search query specificity improvements with real examples
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
