# Database Constraint Violations Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix database constraint violations in the Knowledge_GPT API.

## Problem

The original implementation of `store_search_to_database` had several issues:

1. It did not check for existing records before inserting, leading to duplicate key errors
2. It did not handle primary keys properly, causing constraint violations
3. It lacked proper error handling for database operations
4. It did not support transactions for database operations

## Solution

A new implementation of the database functions has been created in `database_fixed.py` with the following improvements:

### 1. Check for Existing Records

The new `store_search_to_database` function now checks if a record with the same `request_id` already exists before attempting to insert a new one. If an existing record is found, it updates that record instead of trying to insert a new one.

```python
# Check if a record with this request_id already exists
if "request_id" in search_data:
    request_id = search_data["request_id"]
    existing_record = get_search_from_database(request_id)
    
    if existing_record:
        # Update the existing record
        search_id = existing_record["id"]
        search_data["id"] = search_id
        # Use the update method for the existing record
        res = supabase.table("searches").update(search_data).eq("id", search_id).execute()
```

### 2. Proper Primary Key Handling

The function now handles primary keys properly by:
- Using the existing record's ID when updating
- Removing the ID field when inserting a new record to let the database assign one

```python
# This is a new record, proceed with insert
# Remove id if it exists to let the database assign one
if "id" in search_data:
    del search_data["id"]
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling has been added to catch and log all database errors:

```python
try:
    # Database operations
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Database operation error in store_search_to_database: {str(e)}")
    # Log the search_data for debugging (excluding sensitive fields)
    safe_data = {k: v for k, v in search_data.items() if k not in ["behavioral_data", "filters"]}
    logger.error(f"Failed search data: {safe_data}")
    return None
```

### 4. Return Values

The function now returns meaningful values:
- Returns the ID of the inserted or updated record on success
- Returns `None` on failure

This allows the calling code to check if the operation was successful and take appropriate action.

## Testing

A test file `test_database_fixed.py` has been created to verify the fixes. It includes tests for:

1. Storing a new search
2. Updating an existing search
3. Updating a search using its ID
4. Error handling for invalid data

## Integration

The API has been updated in `api/main_fixed_new.py` to use the fixed database functions. The changes include:

1. Importing the fixed database functions
2. Checking the return value of `store_search_to_database` to handle failures
3. Using the fixed `delete_search_from_database` function with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. Run the tests to verify the fixes
2. Deploy the fixed code to the development environment
3. Monitor for any remaining database issues
4. Deploy to production once verified
